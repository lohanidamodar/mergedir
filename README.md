# mergedir
This is a simple python module for merging a directory and all of its sub directories.

It is used to copy all the files in source directory plus
all the files in all of it's sub directory
to a single destination directory, hence merge directories

It checks the files while copying, if they are same it skips,
if they have same name but files are different it renames the file
and copies
